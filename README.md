# CS623-Database-Management

Repository for storing code for my Pace University course CS623 Database Management.

## Graph Databases and Neo4j Research Project

In this research project, my partner and I presented a short video about graph databases and Neo4j. The file in the repository `cs_new_trends_code_demo` is accompanying code to demonstrate the capabilities of Neo4j. It is accompanied by another short video.

## Implementing ACID Properties Programming Project

In this programming project, my partner and I wrote code to implement a query that was assigned to us, and ensure that the ACID properties of Atomicity and Isolation were implemented through the transactions. Our task was to implement these ACID properties for a relational database schema with tables Product and Stock, and ensure that all records with the product ID 'p1' were deleted from both tables, while ensuring that the transaction was committed to the database state if fully implemented, otherwise aborted. Similarly we had to ensure that the transactions were serializable. The file in the repository `cs623_acid_properties.py` is the code. There is also a short video explaining the code.
